# **App Name**: SmartCalc AI

## Core Features:

- AI Smart Mode: Enable smart mode via voice and text input using AI. For example, users can ask 'What is 15% of 2500?' or request a chemistry formula calculation.
- AI-Based Suggestions: The AI tool should analyze current and recent calculations to provide suggestions to the user. If the user calculates a loan amount, suggest calculating EMI. If the user calculates a discount, suggest showing total savings.
- Smooth Animations: Implement soft bounce animations on key presses, slide-in animations for result displays, and 3D flip animations for switching modes.
- Mode Selection: Modes should include Standard, Scientific, Business, Statistics, and AI mode, each accessible via swipeable tabs with unique animations, such as classic slide keypad for Standard mode or card-like flips for Business mode.
- History Mode: Calculations from previous sessions are saved locally in the browser.
- Share Result: Enable users to share the calculation and results in textual format
